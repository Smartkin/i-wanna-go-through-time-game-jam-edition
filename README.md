# I wanna go through time
A very small metroidvania fangame created for I wanna Game Jam 2022 with a theme "Time Travel".
The game didn't end up implementing pretty much anything related to time travel due to time running out.
However, this game's source code is published publicly because unlike other fangames usually using
Game Maker, I wanna go through time is made entirely in Godot 3.5 with my own [fangame engine](https://github.com/Smartkin/godot-fangame-engine) written in Godot as a base.
Hopefully this can encourage other fangame makers to pick up and use Godot when wanting to create ambitious projects where Game Maker is lacking
in a lot of ways.
